This is mksh from CVS on 2012-04-22 with the
following files removed:
• Makefile
  (not part of regular mksh releases anyway)
• dot.mkshrc
  (not needed, we use our own for Android)
• mksh.1
  (manpage; also available from the web)
• strlcpy.c
  (not needed, bionic provides this)

The manual page can be downloaded as PDF (ISO A4 paper) from
https://www.mirbsd.org/MirOS/dist/mir/mksh/mksh.pdf or read
online at https://www.mirbsd.org/man1/mksh (HTML).

The following changes are done to code in this subdirectory
at the moment:
